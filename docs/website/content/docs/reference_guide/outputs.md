## Sysl outputs

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| data    | Data Model diagrams |
| ints    | Integration Diagrams |
| sd      | Sequence Diagrams |
| pb      | Binary Protocol Buffer files of the Sysl definitions |
| protobuf  | Text based Protocol Buffer files of the Sysl definitions |
| export  | Export sysl to Swagger/Open API specification |
| codegen | Generate code with sysl transform models | 
| datamodel| ... | 


## Sysl examples

`sysl` can generate diagrams - Data model diagrams, Integration Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams - and Protobuf intermediate representations from `*.sysl` input files.

### Text based Protocol Buffer output
Protocol buffers is a "language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler". It is a strongly typed binary format used as intermediate representations of Sysl definitions comparable to an abstract syntax tree. The strongly typed protocol buffers are supported in most major programming languages.

Please refer to our developer documentation on how to compile the Protobuf definitions to your preferred porgramming language in order to [create your own Sysl extension]
(https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl#extending-sysl). If you want to generate human readable, text-based Protobuf output use the `textpb` command.

For the following contents of `hello.sysl`

```
HelloWorld:
    !type Message:
        text <: string
```

the command

	sysl textpb hello.sysl --out hello.textpb

generates a `hello.textpb` file. Its contents are

```
apps {
  key: "HelloWorld"
  value {
    name {
      part: "HelloWorld"
    }
    types {
      key: "Message"
      value {
        tuple {
          attr_defs {
            key: "text"
            value {
              primitive: STRING
              source_context {
                start {
                  line: 4
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
